# hello-world
First ever repository on GitHub
Hello all, my name is Bryan. I'm a soon to be 31 year old nurse who's looking to change careers. To do so, I'm learning to code in order to one day (hopefully) secure a job as a developer. I'll be putting my all into this effort, and can't wait to join the rest of you as a contributing member of the community.
