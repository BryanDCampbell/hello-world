# hello-world 
First ever repository on GitHub! <br>
Hello all, my name is Bryan Campbell. I'm a pediatric nurse who's currently looking to change careers. After a heart-to-heart with an old friend, I decided to pursue my interest in learning to code. Eventually, I'm hoping build my skills to the point that I can confidently secure a job as a developer. I'll be putting my all into this effort, and can't wait to join the rest of you as a contributing member of the community. <br>
Pursuing a career was nursing was driven by a desire to give back to my community. Nursing, especially pediatric nursing, is incredibly rewarding work. I feel that my work has made a positive difference in the lives of others, and I am grateful for the opportunity to function in that role. However, nursing can also place an incredible strain on your emotions and physical wellbeing. For my own health, I'm looking to leave the profession within a year. <br>
Becoming a developer is a creative way for me to continue with fulfilling my desire to give back to the community. Completing projects will help connect people and bridge differences.
